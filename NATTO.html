		<p class="text right">Natto is a traditional Japanese food made from soybeans fermented with Bacillus subtilis. Some eat it as a breakfast food. Natto may be an acquired taste because of its powerful smell, strong flavor, and slimy texture. In Japan natto is most popular in the eastern regions, including Kanto, Tohoku, and Hokkaido.</p>
